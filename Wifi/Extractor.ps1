#Finding the USB Drive: The command Get-WmiObject queries for devices with DriveType = 2, which represents removable storage. Replace "USB_LABEL" with the actual label of your USB drive.
#Saving the Output: Once the USB drive is detected, the script saves test.txt with Wi-Fi profiles, passwords, and user information directly to the USB.
#This script will exit with a message if it doesnâ€™t find a USB drive with the specified label.
